Decadal Testbed Paper:

Ames Coronagraph Experiment (ACE)
-designed to develope the PIAACMC coronagraph
-using a single MEMS DM
-two sources to simulate a binary star system
-experiments include maintaining raw contrast with LDFC, wavefront and control techniques to dig dark holes on a field with multiple stars
